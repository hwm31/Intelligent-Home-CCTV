### Overview

The Smart Baby Monitoring System is an AI-powered infant safety management solution that utilizes ESP32 and ESP-Eye modules to create an IoT-based system for real-time monitoring of newborn sleep postures and environmental conditions, providing early detection of dangerous situations and immediate alerts to parents.

This project combines computer vision and environmental sensing technologies to deliver the following core features:
* Face recognition for detecting rollover and dangerous sleep positions
* Temperature and humidity monitoring with optimal environment maintenance alerts
* Movement pattern analysis for sleep quality assessment and anomaly detection
* Real-time video streaming with push notifications for immediate situation updates
* Remote lullaby playback for enhanced childcare convenience

### Use Cases

* Creating safe newborn care environments for dual-income families
* 24/7 monitoring for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) prevention
* Newborn behavior pattern learning and management for first-time parents
* Sleep pattern analysis for optimizing nighttime feeding schedules
* Safe childcare support for grandparents and babysitters

This project proposes an innovative smart childcare solution that goes beyond the limitations of traditional baby monitors by providing AI-based risk prediction and environmental optimization to ensure a safe growth environment for newborns while alleviating parental childcare anxieties.
